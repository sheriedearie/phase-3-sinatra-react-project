# Phase 3 Project

## Getting Started

This repository has all the starter code needed to get a Sinatra backend up and
running. [**Fork and clone**][fork link] this repository to get started. Then, run
`bundle install` to install the gems.

[fork link]: https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-3-sinatra-react-project/fork

The `app/controllers/application_controller.rb` file has an example GET route
handler. Replace this route with routes for your project.

You can start your server with:

```console
$ bundle exec rake server
``` 

or
```console
$ shotgun
``` 

This will run your server on port
[http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292).

## Tips

- Use [Postman][postman download] to test your endpoints.
- Use `binding.pry` to debug your requests on the server. It's very helpful to use a
  `binding.pry` in your controller within a route to see what `params` are being
  sent.
- Use the [Network Tab in the Dev Tools][network tab] in the frontend to debug
  your requests.
